# BLOSSOM-BANK-ONLINE-PAYMENT-FRAUD-DETECTION
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that will help Blossom bank identify fraudulent online payments, stop it, increase their revenue and maintain customer loyalty.
The digitalization of financial procedures and systems has facilitated the increase in online payment fraud which continues to lead to loss of revenue for financial institutions. As a financial organization, Blossom bank needs to be able to identify fraudulent activities so as to increase its revenue and protect the interest of its customers. This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that will help Blossom bank identify fraudulent online payments, stop such transactions, increase its revenue and maintain customer loyalty.
Some of the steps I took during thsi project include: data inspection, data cleansing, data visualization, modelling, train test split, training and testing the models, cross validation and interpretation of results.
At every point during the project, I faced several challenges but every challenge was an opportunity to carry out a personal research, pay attention to details, ask for help when I needed it or to take a rest and revisit the project with a better perspective.
